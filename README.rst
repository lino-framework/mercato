============================
The ``lino_mercato`` package
============================




Lino Mercato is a proof of concept for a company that provides services as a
broker between companies seeking candidates for a job they need to be done and
individual humans who are open to job offers.

The project is in standby mode until we find somebody who wants to invest into
it.
